<h2>Method injection</h2>

<p>In the tutorial you learned how property injection works. But there are other kinds of injection that ModuleInject provides. One is the method injection.</p>

<p>It is performed by using the <code>Inject</code> function.</p>

<h3>Inject function</h3>

<p>So to implement method injection you call an overload of the function <code>Inject</code> which can be used like in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>RegisterPublicComponent(x =&gt; x.Component)
    .Construct&lt;InitializableComponent&gt;()
    .Inject((comp, module) =&gt; comp.Initialize(module.ComponentToInject));
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very flexible approach because you can define any valid lambda EXPRESSION that uses either the module and the component to do something.
You can even call a method repeatedly to e.g. fill a list via the add method.</p>
